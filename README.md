#Digital Forensics Report: Montgomery_72018 Case
## Summary of Investigation
Using Autopsy, I looked at  Georgeâ€™s USB drive for signs of illegal activity. I recovered deleted documents, examined file timestamps, and tagged 16 notable files. These included domain resale records, payment tracking spreadsheets, and email communications.

## Findings
- Evidence of domain sales that were unauthorized
- Credentials that were deleted with FTP access
- Financial records that suggested personal profit
- Using work resources business hours

## Repeatable Process
All information was found using repeatable digital forensic methods. 

##1 ** How did George's manager acquire the disk?**
George's manager got the disk as part of an investigation after suspicious activity and possible domain fraud. He arranged to meet with the IT manager and interview him to then pick up the storage media. AFter the interview he completed the evidence form, signed it, and had the IT manager sign it as well. The storage media was then put in a bag for evidence, stored in a secure location, and then a chain of custody form was used to maintain the integrity before being handed over to the forensic analysis team.

##2 ** Did George perform the work on a laptop, which is his own property? If so, did he conduct business transactions on his break or during his lunch hour? **
Evidence from autopsy indicates that George used a work issued device and not his personal laptop. The use of office documents, email communications, and domain related data indicate it was done on a company machine. No evidence claims that he completed these tasks during non work hours. Multiple deleted and non work related files such as Billing Letter.doc and income.xls suggest George's using the company resources for unauthorized business transactions.

##3 ** At what times of the day was George using the non work related files? How did you retreive this information?**
Files like letter1.txt and Billing Letter.doc indicate modified times between 6:50 and 6:53am pst on 2005-12-09. These times were retrieved from File Metadata tab in Autopsy for each document. With multiple incidents found, George was actively engaged in non work activity during working hours.

##4 **Which company policies apply?**
Company policies include and are not limited to: use of company systems, confidentiality, prohibition of personal business activity during company hours. George violated many policies by using company assets to complete solicit payments and manage domain resales. This includes threats made to clients.

##5 **Are there any other items that need to be considered?**
These include deleted files, financial records, victim impact, and potential accomplice.
